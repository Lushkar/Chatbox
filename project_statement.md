In this assignment, you will develop a simple Web server to which clients would connect. You need to create a chat box, which may be accomplished by creating a webserver through which a minimum of 2 clients communicating with each other. This chat box should be password protected, which means that the server will manage a database (in any suitable format, preferably in ‘.csv ’) and when the clients will connect to the server, it will ask for the username and password which upon verification will share a list of usernames to the clients from which client will select a name and server will match the name/token from both clients. If matched, they both should receive a message that “you are allowed to chat now” and messages of the respective clients should pass through the server. At the end you may end the chat by sending some specific character or string. 
Both the client and server side coding should be done in python language (involving socket programming). You will be asked to submit a detailed report, present in class and answer to the viva questions at the end of the deadline.
